# Offchain API Source (Server)
This is a small Python Flask API that can be run locally or within a Docker container. It's meant to demonstrate what your server will look like generating model inference and forecast to be called by the adapter

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* Flask
* Docker (if you want to run the API in a Docker container)

### Installing Dependencies
Before running the API, you need to install the required dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the API Locally
To run the Flask API locally, use the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will start the Flask development server on http://127.0.0.1:8000/

### Running the API with Docker
Alternatively, you can run the API using Docker.
```bash
docker build -t offchain-api-source .
```
Run the Docker container
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 offchain-api-source
```
This will start the Flask API server on http://localhost:8000/
